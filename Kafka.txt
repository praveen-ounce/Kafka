// Save the file

// Next Open a command prompt with the path ".\kafka_2.13-3.4.0"and execute the following command to start the Zookeeper(broker)
> .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

// To run the  kafka server Run the following command by opening another terminal with same path as above
> '.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties'

// Now Create a topic by opening another terminal with the path ".\kafka_2.13-3.4.0\bin\windows" and execute the following command
> kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic topic-name
// You will see a prompt message 
> Created topic topic-name.

// Now Run the Producer in the same terminal (choice) with the following command
> kafka-console-producer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic-name

// Producer will ask for a prompt message which you can send to the consumer in json format
// Enter a json object in the prompt
Ex: {"message":"App is under maintenace","status":false} (Do not hit Enter until consumer is created)

// Now run the Consumer in another terminal with the path ".\kafka_2.13-3.4.0\bin\windows" and execute the following command
> kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic-name

// Now hit Enter in producer terminal with the json object
// You can see the same object in the consumer terminal
// So you can send as many messages as you want to consume

// To Get the messages from the producer to consumer from beginning use the following command
> kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic-name --from-beginning

// To list all the topics in Kafka use the following command in the path ".\kafka_2.13-3.4.0\bin\windows"
> kafka-topics.bat --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
